# Digital Bookstore

## ✍️ App overview

This app is my final project for the Naicoms Academy 2022. It was created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP. It allows the users to easily find and buy their favourite/wishlisted books.

## 🌎 Public part

The pages which are accessible to guests are:
* Home - `/`
* Login - `/login`
* Register - `/register`

## 👤 Private part

The pages and features that are accessible to all logged-in users are:

* Dashboard - `/books`
* Book details - `/books/:id`
* Rating - `/books/:id/rating`
* Author - `/authors/:id`
* Wishlist - `/wishlist`
* Shopping cart - `/cart`
* Order form - `/order`

<br />
Every logged-in user has the opportunity to explore books and see their details. They can vote for a particular book based on a star rating system (1 - 5) and view the average rating for the selected book. To-be-read books can be added to/removed from a wishlist or directly sent to the shopping cart. To finalize an order, each user has to fill in an order form with their personal and address data.
If a user would like to explore more of the content of a particular author, they can do that by visiting the author's page.
